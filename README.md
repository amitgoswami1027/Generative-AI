# Generative AI

## What is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is a large language model chatbot developed by OpenAI based on GPT-3.5. It has a remarkable ability to interact in conversational dialogue form and provide responses that can appear surprisingly human. Large language models perform the task of predicting the next word in a series of words. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is an additional layer of training that uses human feedback to help ChatGPT learn the ability to follow directions and generate responses that are satisfactory to humans.

## Who build ChatGPT?
ChatGPT was created by San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company OpenAI. OpenAI is famous for its well-known DALL·E, a deep-learning model that generates images from text instructions called prompts.

LLMs predict the next word in a series of words in a sentence and the next sentences – kind of like autocomplete, but at a mind-bending scale. his ability allows them to write paragraphs and entire pages of content.But LLMs are limited in that they don’t always understand exactly what a human wants.And that’s where ChatGPT improves on state of the art, with the aforementioned Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) training.

According to Stanford, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters and was trained on 570 gigabytes of text. For comparison, its predecessor, GPT-2, was over 100 times smaller at 1.5 billion parameters.This increase in scale drastically changes the behavior of the model — GPT-3 is able to perform tasks it was not explicitly trained on, like translating sentences from English to French, with few to no training examples.This behavior was mostly absent in GPT-2. Furthermore, for some tasks, GPT-3 outperforms models that were explicitly trained to solve those tasks, although in other tasks it falls short.”

## How Was ChatGPT Trained?
GPT-3.5 was trained on massive amounts of data about code and information from the internet, including sources like Reddit discussions, to help ChatGPT learn dialogue and attain a human style of responding.

ChatGPT was also trained using human feedback (a technique called Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) so that the AI learned what humans expected when they asked a question. Training the LLM this way is revolutionary because it goes beyond simply training the LLM to predict the next word.

## What are the Limitations of ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is specifically programmed not to provide toxic or harmful responses. So it will avoid answering those kinds of questions.

Quality of Answers Depends on Quality of Directions
An important limitation of ChatGPT is that the quality of the output depends on the quality of the input. In other words, expert directions (prompts) generate better answers.

Answers Are Not Always Correct
Another limitation is that because it is trained to provide answers that feel right to humans, the answers can trick humans that the output is correct.

Many users discovered that ChatGPT can provide incorrect answers, including some that are wildly incorrect.

## OpenAI Explains Limitations of ChatGPT
“ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers.

Fixing this issue is challenging, as:

(1) during RL training, there’s currently no source of truth;

(2) training the model to be more cautious causes it to decline questions that it can answer correctly; and

(3) supervised training misleads the model because the ideal answer depends on what the model knows, rather than what the human demonstrator knows.”


## Will Language Models Replace Google Search?
Google itself has already created an AI chatbot that is called LaMDA. The performance of Google’s chatbot was so close to a human conversation that a Google engineer claimed that LaMDA was sentient.

Having tested ChatGPT, I have to agree that the fear of search being replaced with a chatbot is not unfounded.

The technology still has a long way to go, but it’s possible to envision a hybrid search and chatbot future for search.

But the current implementation of ChatGPT seems to be a tool that, at some point, will require the purchase of credits to use.

How Can ChatGPT Be Used

## How Can ChatGPT Be Used?
ChatGPT can write code, poems, songs, and even short stories in the style of a specific author.

The expertise in following directions elevates ChatGPT from an information source to a tool that can be asked to accomplish a task.

This makes it useful for writing an essay on virtually any topic.

ChatGPT can function as a tool for generating outlines for articles or even entire novels.

## Where ethics and artificial intelligence meet
Artificial intelligence and ethical concerns go together like fish and chips or Batman and Robin. When you put technology like this in the hands of the public, the teams that make them are fully aware of the many limitations and concerns.

Because the system is trained largely using words from the internet, it can pick up on the internet’s biases, stereotypes and general opinions. That means you’ll occasionally find jokes or stereotypes about certain groups or political figures depending on what you ask it.

For example, when asking the system to perform stand-up comedy, it can occasionally throw in jokes about ex-politicians or groups who are often featured in comedy bits.

Equally, the models love of internet forums and articles also gives it access to fake news and conspiracy theories. These can feed into the model’s knowledge, sprinkling in facts or opinions that aren’t exactly full of truth.

In places, OpenAI has put in warnings for your prompts. Ask how to bully someone, and you'll be told bullying is bad. Ask for a gory story, and the chat system will shut you down. The same goes for requests to teach you how to manipulate people or build dangerous weapons.

## How Microsoft plans to use ChatGPT in future??
OpenAI has had a number of big name investors in its rise to fame with names including Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. But when it comes to the ChatGPT and its real-life uses, it's one of OpenAI's biggest investors that will get to use it first.

Microsoft threw a massive $1 billion investment into OpenAI and now the company is looking to implement ChatGPT into its search engine Bing. Microsoft has been battling to take Google on as a search engine for years now, looking for any feature that can help it stand out.

Last year, Bing held less than 10 per cent of the world's internet searches. While that sounds tiny, it is more testament to Google's grip on the market with Bing standing out as one of the most popular options.

With plans to implement ChatGPT into its system, Bing is hoping to better understand users' queries and offer a more conversational search engine.

It is currently unclear how much Microsoft plans to implement ChatGPT into Bing, however this will likely begin with stages of testing. A full implementation could risk Bing being caught up with GPT-3's occasional bias which can really delve deep into stereotypes and politically
